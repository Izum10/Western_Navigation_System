# INTRODUCTION
- Western University has created floor plans for all its buildings to help people navigate inside them. 
- Although the main purpose of these maps is to help people with disabilities find accessible features on campus, they can also be useful for anyone who wants to find a specific room.
- However, the maps are only provided as PDF files with no searchable metadata and limited accessibility information.
- The goal of this project is to develop an application that utilizes Western's floor plans and allows users to search and explore the interior spaces. 
- The application will allow users to search for rooms, locate points of interest, browse the maps, and create and save personal points of interest. 
- Additionally, the application will have a tool for developers to easily create and edit map metadata.

# DESCRIPTION
- Users are able to navigate through several maps on campus, and through buildings.
- Users can add points of interest (POI) to a list of "favourites" and are shown the current weather in London, Ontario
- Admins can modify points of interest, buildings, and floors in buildings
- NOTE: Users will require internet access to receive current weather data

# HOW TO OPERATE
- Please select the logControllerGUI.java file and input the valid login details above.

# NOTE
- The codebase features JavaDocs for all files; however, generating documentation posed consistent challenges. 
- Despite attempts to force a JavaDocs file for the entire project, this was not achievable due to the integration of packages such as JSON.simple, resulting in a decision to forego generating the documentation to avoid introducing further errors.
